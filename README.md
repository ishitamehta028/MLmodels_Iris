The ML Models used on the Iris Dataset are -
## 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies new data points based on their proximity to existing data points in a training set.

## 2. Decision Tree
A decision tree is a flowchart-like model that makes predictions based on a series of decisions about the features of a given data point.

## 3. Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## 4. Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm that calculates the probability of a given data point belonging to a certain class based on its feature values.

## 5. Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that uses a logistic function to model the probability of a data point belonging to a certain class.

## 6.Support Vector Machines (SVM)
SVM is a powerful algorithm for both classification and regression that separates data points into different classes by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between them.

## 7. Gradient Boosting
Gradient boosting is an ensemble algorithm that builds multiple decision trees in a sequential manner and optimizes the loss function at each step.

## 8. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
ANN is a machine learning model that mimics the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes or neurons that process and transmit information.

## 9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible.

## 10. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
GMM is a probabilistic clustering algorithm that models each cluster as a mixture of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.
